# My Reads project

## About

First project from the React Developer Nanodegree in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/): In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

The `src` directory is divided in three parts, each one with a different purpose:

- `main` - As the name implies, this folder contains the main code for the project, being it the wrapper for all the files where the app's functionality is implemented.
- `res` - Resources to be used by the application, including images, stylesheets or mock data files that can be used for testing purposes.
- `test` - Code for unit testing is wrapped into this folder.
